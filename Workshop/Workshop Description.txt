If you have any problems with mod or errors occur, you should describe your problem as much detailed as possible, comments like “mod does not work” will be ignored.
Also, you should provide the game log, comments about errors without game log will be ignored too. Read [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=463645931]here[/url] how to share log. 

Although, the best way to solve problems is joining to my discord and write to [b]#Support[/b] channel, unfortunately, steam comments is very useless for conversation.
